The file "words" in this folder contains a list of words from Webster's Second International Dictionary (1934). The copyright has lapsed, and this file is included in Unix and OS X (and found at /usr/share/dict/words) as a reference wordlist for various uses. It is used in the Word Anagram Project (Chapter 3) in this course.
